# SPH-Simulation
High-Performance Computing Project - Smoothed-Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) Simulation

The objective of the project was to write a parallelised numerical code for solving a 
2D smmothed-particle hydrodynamic (SPH) formulation of the Navier-Stokes equations.

The project involved implementing ALL C++ coding concepts learnt during the HPC module.
These include basic coding fundamentals such as loops, conditional statements, functions, etc.,
to C++ specific concepts such as classes and the use of external libraries for scientific
computing, e.g., BLAS & LAPACK.

Code optimisation techniques such as parallelisation, pre-computations, arranging nested 
loops to exploit cache locality, etc., were implemented to maximised performance.

Energy plots of the different flow setups and results of the code optimisation are
recorded in the .pdf file.
